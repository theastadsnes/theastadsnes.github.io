## My Blog
Hello and welcome to my first ever blog! I am an exchange student at UQ, and I am currently in my fourth year of my masters in Cybernetics and Robotics. This year i am taking the course ELEC4630 - Computer Vision and Deep Learning, and this platform will be used as a place to document what I learn as well as my progress within [fastai](https://www.fast.ai).
