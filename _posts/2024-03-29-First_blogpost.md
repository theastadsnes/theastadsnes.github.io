# What is fastai?

In my first blogpost I wanted to talk about fastai as this is something we will be working with in Assignment 2 in ELEC4630. What is it? Why are we using it? What makes it so good?

**fastai** is a Python library that helps us build deep learning models quickly and easily. It’s built on top of PyTorch, which is a more low-level library. While PyTorch gives you a lot of flexibility, it can also be overwhelming. fastai wraps that complexity in clean, readable code — so we can focus on learning and experimenting, not getting stuck in setup.

What’s awesome about fastai is that it follows something called the **"whole game" approach**. That means you can train a powerful image classifier, like recognizing cats vs dogs, in just a few lines of code — even before fully understanding how it works under the hood. This approach lets us get hands-on experience first and gradually learn the deeper theory as we go.

Some reasons fastai is a good choice:
- ✅ **Beginner-friendly** – great for students and non-experts.
- 🚀 **State-of-the-art** – used in research and production.
- 🧠 **Best practices built-in** – handles lots of tricky stuff like data augmentation, model fine-tuning, and metrics.
- 🛠️ **Flexible** – you can go as deep or as simple as you want.

So basically, fastai helps us get stuff done without drowning in complexity. That’s why it’s a great tool for our course — we can focus on the actual deep learning concepts instead of getting lost in the code setup.

Looking forward to diving into Assignment 2 and seeing what we can build!
