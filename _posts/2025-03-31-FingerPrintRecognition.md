# Finger print recognition system

In the first task of Assignment 2 we were asked to:

Design a GUI and template
file/database which allows you to:
a. Enroll a fingerprint and associate a name. Store the template in a file or
database
b. Compare a new fingerprint to the fingerprints in the gallery
c. Evaluate your system on several fingerprints and adjust the threshold for
good performance with low error rates
d. Produce a ROC curve showing error rates versus threshold
e. Estimate the false positive rate (false alarm rate) for a false negative rate of
1%.
