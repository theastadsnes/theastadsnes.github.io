# Finger print recognition system

In the first task of Assignment 2 we were asked to:

Design a GUI and template file/database which allows you to:

- [a. Enroll a fingerprint and associate a name](#a-enroll-a-fingerprint-and-associate-a-name)
- [b. Compare a new fingerprint to the fingerprints in the gallery](#b-compare-a-new-fingerprint-to-the-fingerprints-in-the-gallery)
- [c. Evaluate your system on several fingerprints and adjust the threshold for good performance with low error rates](#c-evaluate-your-system-on-several-fingerprints-and-adjust-the-threshold-for-good-performance-with-low-error-rates)
- [d. Produce a ROC curve showing error rates versus threshold](#d-produce-a-roc-curve-showing-error-rates-versus-threshold)
- [e. Estimate the false positive rate (false alarm rate) for a false negative rate of 1%](#e-estimate-the-false-positive-rate-false-alarm-rate-for-a-false-negative-rate-of-1)

## a. Enroll a fingerprint and associate a name

_Explanation or code for enrolling a fingerprint and storing the template._

---

## b. Compare a new fingerprint to the fingerprints in the gallery

_Explanation or code for matching a fingerprint against the gallery._

## c. Evaluate your system on several fingerprints and adjust the threshold for good performance with low error rates

_How you tested and optimized the threshold for accuracy and reliability._

---

## d. Produce a ROC curve showing error rates versus threshold

_Code or discussion about generating a ROC curve and what it shows._
