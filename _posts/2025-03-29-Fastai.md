# What is fastai?

In this blog post, I will introduce the fastai library, which we are currently working with in Assignment 2 of ELEC4630. After reviewing the material on the [fastai course website](https://course.fast.ai/) and exploring the accompanying *fastbook*, I found it helpful to reflect on what fastai is, why we are using it, and what makes it particularly effective for learning and applying deep learning techniques.

## Introduction to fastai

**fastai** is an open-source deep learning library built on top of PyTorch. It is designed to simplify the process of training state-of-the-art models in computer vision, natural language processing, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. One of the core goals of fastai is to make deep learning more accessible by providing high-level abstractions, while still allowing flexibility for more advanced use cases.

Unlike many traditional approaches to machine learning education, the fastai course emphasizes a top-down teaching method. Students are introduced to practical applications from the very beginning, building working models before delving into the underlying theory. This approach not only accelerates learning but also helps solidify theoretical concepts through hands-on experience.

## Example: Pet Image Classifier

An excellent example of this approach is shown in Chapter 1 of the *fastbook*, which is available to run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/01_intro.ipynb). In this notebook, a full image classification model is trained on the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset using just a few lines of code:

```python
from fastai.vision.all import *

path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'

def is_cat(x): return x[0].isupper()

dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(
    path, get_image_files(path), valid_pct=0.2,
    label_func=is_cat, item_tfms=Resize(224)
)

learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)
learn.fine_tune(1)
```
